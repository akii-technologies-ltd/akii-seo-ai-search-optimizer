# Changelog

All notable changes to **Akii — SEO & AI Search Optimizer** are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.6.14] — 2026-05-26

### Changed
- Four commands (`/translate-content`, `/generate-schema`, `/generate-llms-txt`, `/keyword-cluster`) are now thin slash-command wrappers around their sibling skills (`content-translation`, `schema-markup`, `llms-txt`, `keyword-clustering`). The full procedure for each operation now lives in a single source of truth — the skill body — and the command file documents argument parsing plus delegates to the skill via an in-repo link. Eliminates the drift risk where skill-body updates (like the v2.6.13 top-10 locale baseline) weren't reflected in the command file. Both invocation surfaces (natural-language skill trigger AND `$ARGUMENTS`-parsed slash command) continue to work; no external behavior change.

## [2.6.13] — 2026-05-26

### Changed
- **`content-translation` skill** and **`/translate-content` command** now document a top-10 baseline locale list (`zh-CN`, `es-ES`/`es-MX`, `hi-IN`, `ar-SA`/`ar-AE`, `pt-BR`, `ru-RU`, `ja-JP`, `de-DE`, `fr-FR`, `id-ID`) and explicitly frame the picker as suggestions, not a supported set. The 4-option picker shows 3 context-relevant locales plus a 4th "Other / free-text" option that accepts any BCP-47 code, so users no longer perceive a 3-language cap. Multi-locale invocations (e.g. `de-DE, fr-FR, es-ES`) are now an explicit accepted input.

## [2.6.12] — 2026-05-26

### Changed
- **`content-strategy` skill** now requires a live audit (Ahrefs Site Explorer / GSC or WebFetch on the homepage plus 2-3 representative pages) before emitting any claim about the target site's current state. Prior-session context bleed and training-data inference no longer count. The Audit findings section opens with a `Site audit signals:` line listing exactly which sources were invoked.
- **`content-strategy` skill** Publishing queue's Volume + KD columns now require `mcp__plugin_marketing_ahrefs__keywords-explorer-*`. Without it, the columns are either omitted or every cell is suffixed `(no Ahrefs — heuristic)` so users know the number is a model prior rather than measured research.
- **`content-strategy` skill** explicitly bans unverified context-inheritance claims (e.g. "Inherits context from prior /ai-visibility + /competitor-intel runs") unless those runs actually executed in the current session.

## [2.6.11] — 2026-05-26

### Changed
- **`content-brief`, `optimize-page`, and `seo-audit` skills** now enforce title and meta-description character limits as HARD LIMITS rather than soft guidelines. The skill bodies instruct the model to count BEFORE proposing the value and re-trim if over, with explicit guidance on common over-run patterns (trailing "& X" clauses, year stamps, "the …" qualifiers). Title hard limit is 60 chars including spaces; meta description hard limit is 155 chars (`content-brief`, `optimize-page`) or 160 chars (`seo-audit`, matching the SEO industry-standard range).

## [2.6.10] — 2026-05-26

### Changed
- **`ai-visibility` skill** brand-confirmation guard expanded to cover ambiguous brands, not only opaque acronyms. Common surnames + generic English words that map to multiple known entities in the same vertical (`draper.vc` → 5+ Draper VC firms, `wilson.com` → Wilson Sporting Goods vs Wilson & Co vs Allan Wilson Consulting) now trigger a confirmation echo before the Akii scan. Confirmation is skipped only when the domain root is genuinely unique (`stripe.com`, `anthropic.com`, etc.).
- **`ai-visibility` skill** verifies Akii competitor domains before rendering the competitors block. Each `competitor.domain` from the Akii API gets a `curl -sI` check; if the response is 404 or redirects to an unrelated brand, the rendered row is annotated with the discrepancy (observed: Sequoia Capital returned as `sequoia.com`, real domain is `sequoiacap.com`). Discrepancies are surfaced, never silently corrected.

## [2.6.9] — 2026-05-26

### Changed
- **`ai-visibility` skill** Phase 0 reachability check now handles WAF responses deterministically. Sites behind Cloudflare, Akamai, or similar that return 4xx / 5xx on HEAD requests are treated as reachable when WAF signature headers are present (`cf-ray`, `server: cloudflare`, `AkamaiGHost`, `x-akamai-*`, `server: ATS`, `x-iinfo`). The final report notes the WAF vendor so users understand the health-check status came from bot-protection rather than an outage.
- **`ai-visibility` skill** Phase 2 now requires a `Signals consulted:` line above the per-engine table listing which live signal sources were actually invoked. Training-data inference alone no longer counts — at least one of Ahrefs Brand Radar, Apify, WebSearch, or a successful WebFetch must back the numbers. When no live signal is available, the per-engine table is replaced with the "insufficient signal data" skeleton.

## [2.6.8] — 2026-05-26

### Changed
- **`ai-visibility` skill** now runs a Phase 0 reachability + brand-confirmation guard before calling the Akii API. If the domain doesn't resolve (`ECONNREFUSED`, DNS failure, timeout), the skill stops and asks the user to confirm the domain or supply an explicit `brandName` instead of letting the LLM judge hallucinate a brand identity from the domain string and burning a daily quota slot.
- **`ai-visibility` skill** runs a post-scan brand-resolution sanity check. If the LLM judge anchored on a brand that doesn't match the supplied `brandName` or the domain root, the mismatch is surfaced before the score — preventing 200-line reports about a different company than the user asked for.
- **`ai-visibility` skill** adds a zero-signal hard stop in Phase 2. When no Ahrefs Brand Radar MCP, no Apify, no WebFetch, no WebSearch signal data is available, the per-engine map is replaced with an "insufficient signal data" skeleton listing what would unlock Phase 2 — instead of emitting per-engine numbers that have no underlying signal.

## [2.6.7] — 2026-05-26

### Changed
- **`broken-links` skill** parallel-verify shell pattern switched from bare `$1` / `$0` positional references to the curly-brace form (`${1}` / `${0}`). Claude Code's skill renderer strips bare positional-argument tokens from loaded skill bodies, which silently left the shipped command with empty quotes (`""`) and a missing `${url}` payload in the `-w` format string. The curly-brace form survives the renderer and runs correctly.
- **`technical-seo` skill** PageSpeed Insights example switched from `$AKII_PSI_KEY` to `${AKII_PSI_KEY}` defensively against the same renderer behavior.

## [2.6.6] — 2026-05-26

### Changed
- **`broken-links` skill** parallel-verify pattern fixed for URLs containing `&` (e.g. UTM query strings). Previous `xargs -P 5 -I {}` form failed with *"command line cannot be assembled, too long"* on real-world links; corrected to `xargs -P 5 -n 1 sh -c '…' _` with positional `$1`. Skill body now ships the working pattern plus a pre-filter step that strips template placeholders (`example.com`, `<url>`, bare `web.archive.org/`, empty UTM values) before verification, and adds Cloudflare / WAF 403 responses to the false-positive list alongside the existing auth-walled domains.

## [2.6.5] — 2026-05-26

### Changed
- **`broken-links` skill** now verifies external URLs in parallel (`xargs -P 5` with 200ms stagger per worker) instead of a sequential shell loop. A 45-link repo audit now completes in ~10s instead of ~90s while staying at the documented ~5/s rate limit. Mode `local` step 4, Mode `page` step 3, and the Rules section all reference the same parallel pattern.

## [2.6.4] — 2026-05-26

### Changed
- Update instructions corrected to match Claude Code's actual marketplace-update mechanism. There is no per-plugin update slash command. Two paths offered: one-time refresh (`/plugin marketplace update akii` + `/reload-plugins`) or auto-update (`/plugin` → Marketplaces tab → akii → Enable auto-update). Updated in the README **Updating** section, the session-end notification, and `hooks/README.md`.

## [2.6.3] — 2026-05-26

### Changed
- Update instructions now point at `/plugin` → Installed → Update (the actual Claude Code path) instead of an invalid `/plugin update <name>@<marketplace>` slash command. Updated in README (new **Updating** section), the SessionEnd notification, and `hooks/README.md`.

## [2.6.2] — 2026-05-26

### Changed
- Session-end notification leads with **"Upgrade for continuous AI visibility monitoring"** for clearer platform-pitch framing.

## [2.6.1] — 2026-05-26

### Removed
- `/ai-visibility-score` command. Natural-language invocation of the `ai-visibility` skill covers every path. Commands count: 8 → 7.

### Changed
- **`broken-links` skill** now offers three explicit modes:
  - `local` — full-repo audit via `Glob` + `Grep` + batched verification (no upper limit on link discovery).
  - `page` — single-URL deep check (~30-100 outbound links per run).
  - `site` — multi-page crawl via Ahrefs site-audit MCP when connected.
  Auth-walled false-positive list added (LinkedIn profiles, Stripe dashboard, Notion private pages, GitHub private repos) — these now report as "not publicly verifiable" instead of 404.
- **`competitor-intel` skill** now asks which scan mode to run:
  - **Quick** (~10s) — surfaces 5 likely competitors from SERP signals.
  - **Comprehensive** (~30-60s) — multi-source discovery with Ahrefs `site-explorer-organic-competitors` MCP integration when connected + homepage analysis.
  - **Custom** — user supplies the competitor list.
  Discovery surfaces candidates with co-occurrence evidence so the user can edit confidently before the scorecard runs.
- README example domain.

## [2.6.0] — 2026-05-26

### Added
- **Update notifications.** `scripts/akii-cta.sh` does a cached (24h TTL) version check against the GitHub Releases API. When the installed version is behind the latest release, the SessionEnd notification appends:
  ```
  ⚙  Update available: vX.Y.Z installed · vA.B.C released
     To update once: /plugin marketplace update akii  then  /reload-plugins
     To auto-update: /plugin → Marketplaces → akii → Enable auto-update
  ```
- `AKII_PLUGIN_DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK=1` env var silences just the notification while keeping the rest of the CTA (existing `AKII_PLUGIN_DISABLE_CTA=1` still silences the whole hook).
- Cache lives at `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/akii-plugin/version-check` (falls back to `~/.cache/akii-plugin/version-check`).
- Network errors, missing curl, locked cache dir → version check silently skipped, plain CTA still renders. Hook never aborts the user's session-end.

## [2.5.1] — 2026-05-26

### Changed
- README + `plugin.json` + AUTHORITIES.md now lead with "All skills run on your Claude Code session model" (Claude Sonnet / Opus / etc).
- The Llama 4 / DeepSeek backend is documented as scoped specifically to the AI Visibility Score (one skill — Phase 1 of `ai-visibility`).
- AUTHORITIES.md adds a "How the plugin runs at all" section.

## [2.5.0] — 2026-05-26

### Changed
- **`ai-visibility` skill** documents Phase 1 (Akii backend, Llama 4 / DeepSeek V4 Pro as LLM judge against your brand's public footprint) + Phase 2 (per-engine signal-correlation proxy using FirstPageSage data).
- Explicit "What this skill is NOT" section in `ai-visibility` body — clarifies the plugin estimates via two proxy mechanisms rather than directly querying ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini / Perplexity / Copilot. Direct multi-engine querying is positioned as an Akii platform feature.
- **AUTHORITIES.md** adds a "What this plugin actually measures" section explaining Phase 1 and Phase 2 mechanics + what direct querying requires (paid Akii platform or Ahrefs Brand Radar MCP).
- README + `plugin.json` + `marketplace.json` descriptions updated to match.
- `seo-audit` footer CTA distinguishes the plugin's one-shot scoring from the platform's direct per-engine queries.

## [2.4.1] — 2026-05-26

### Changed
- `optimize-page` Layer 2 (AEO) explicitly framed as **helpful writing structure** (Google-endorsed: direct-answer leads, definition blocks, FAQs), distinct from artificial AI-targeted chunking which Google's guide rejects. Same framing applied to `/check-file`.
- `schema-markup` skill opens with Google's stance: structured data is useful for rich results, not required for AI search.
- `technical-seo` skill opens with an Authority section linking [Google's "Build and maintain a clear technical structure"](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/ai-optimization-guide#build-and-maintain-a-clear-technical-structure) guidance.
- `content-strategy` skill opens with an "Anchoring principle — non-commodity content" section per Google's guidance.

## [2.4.0] — 2026-05-26

### Added
- **AUTHORITIES.md** — explicit source matrix scoping each citation: [Google's AI Optimization Guide](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/ai-optimization-guide) → Google AI Overviews + AI Mode; [Princeton/IIT Delhi paper (Aggarwal et al., KDD 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09735) → cross-engine GEO tactics (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Copilot, standalone Gemini); [FirstPageSage GEO Algorithm Breakdown](https://firstpagesage.com/seo-blog/generative-engine-optimization-geo-explanation/) → per-engine signal correlations.

### Changed
- README intro leads with "Aligned with Google's AI Optimization Guide" + extends to the 5 other engines where Google has no jurisdiction. Links AUTHORITIES.md.
- `optimize-page` Layer 3 (GEO) split into two halves:
  - **Half A — Google AI Overviews + AI Mode**: authority is Google's guide. Foundational SEO, helpful content.
  - **Half B — Cross-engine (ChatGPT, Claude, standalone Gemini, Perplexity, Copilot)**: authority is the Princeton paper. Five tactics with the +40% paper-benchmark lift.
- `llms-txt` skill opens with a scoping note: Google's guide does not list `llms.txt` as a consumed signal; the file is for non-Google AI crawlers (Anthropic, Perplexity, Cohere).
- `ai-visibility` per-engine table: Google AI Overviews row cites Google's guide and routes the fix path to `seo-audit` + `optimize-page`.
- `seo-audit` opens with an Authority section linking Google's guide + AUTHORITIES.md.

## [2.3.0] — 2026-05-26

### Added
- **CI** — `.github/workflows/validate.yml` runs `bash scripts/validate.sh` + `bash scripts/test-bump-version.sh` on every PR and push.
- **bump-version self-test** — `scripts/test-bump-version.sh` runs in a tmp clone.
- **Validator §0 preflight** — checks `python3` / `jq` / `grep` / `sed` on PATH.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — repo layout, validator gate, skill / agent / command authoring conventions, citation rules, release process.
- **SECURITY.md** — supported-versions table, responsible-disclosure address (security@akii.com), threat model, out-of-scope list.
- **COMPATIBILITY.md** — Claude Code version matrix, OS coverage, required shell tooling, third-party MCP table.

## [2.2.1] — 2026-05-26

### Changed
- `scripts/bump-version.sh` + validator now keep `User-Agent` strings pinned to `plugin.json` version on every bump.
- AKII_PSI_KEY env var has a working recipe in `technical-seo` skill body.
- `brandDomain` input sanitization rule added to `ai-visibility` skill: validation regex `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*(\.[a-z0-9-]+)+$` + explicit refusal rule (defense-in-depth against shell injection).
- `scripts/bump-version.sh` prefers `jq` when available; portable BSD/GNU `sed` fallback; NUL-safe iteration for repo paths with spaces.
- `scripts/validate.sh` §1 checks `marketplace.json` schema symmetrically with `plugin.json`.
- `scripts/validate.sh` §12 pins User-Agent strings to plugin.json version.
- `scripts/validate.sh` §13 trigger-overlap heuristic excludes phrases inside NOT-carve-out sentences.
- `scripts/akii-cta.sh` simplified: explicit `if ! cat; then emit_silent_approve` covers all failure paths consistently across bash 3.2 (macOS) and bash 4+.
- `hooks/README.md` documents the SessionEnd hook intent + opt-out + failure policy.
- `ai-visibility` skill fallback model chain clarified: GET in step 1 is authoritative; the fallback fires only when the GET itself fails.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-05-26

### Added
- `scripts/bump-version.sh` writes both `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json` in lockstep.
- `ai-visibility` skill ships **two output templates**: Template A (Akii API live — full Phase 1 + Phase 2 report) and Template B (offline mode — Phase 2 proxy only). One-line status banner at top of each.
- README **Routing contract** documents the skill ↔ agent boundary across all pairs.
- README **Compatibility** section: tested Claude Code version range, plugin-spec versions, OS coverage.
- Validator gains four semantic checks: §9 manifest version lockstep, §10 cross-reference resolver, §11 README counts ↔ filesystem, §12 pairwise trigger-phrase overlap warning.

### Changed
- `scripts/akii-cta.sh` failure path simplified — silent `{"decision":"approve"}` fallback if anything fails. Hook never aborts session-end.
- Three skill ↔ agent pairs now follow the explicit NOT-carve-out pattern in descriptions: `schema-markup` ↔ `schema-generator`, `ai-visibility` ↔ `ai-visibility-analyzer`, `content-strategy` ↔ `content-strategist`.
- Princeton citation wording: "tactics published by the Princeton/IIT Delhi GEO study" (correct: the paper validated the *tactics*, not the plugin).

## [2.1.0] — 2026-05-26

### Added
- `optimize-page` skill documents the `--mode=<value>` detection precedence (explicit flag → trailing arg → natural-language keyword → default `full`). Resolved mode is printed at the top of every run for transparency.
- `scripts/akii-cta.sh` honors `AKII_PLUGIN_DISABLE_CTA=1` to silence the SessionEnd CTA.

### Changed
- `competitor-intel` skill description tightened as the fast-path default for any competitor question. The `competitor-analyzer` agent fires only on explicit "deep analysis" / "agent mode" / 5+ competitors.

## [2.0.1] — 2026-05-26

### Changed
- `optimize-page` skill + supporting docs correctly attribute the GEO study: **Aggarwal et al., *GEO: Generative Engine Optimization* (KDD 2024, [arXiv:2311.09735](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09735))** — authored by Princeton + IIT Delhi + Independent (Seattle) + Georgia Tech.
- `ai-visibility` skill attributes per-engine signal numbers to their source: [FirstPageSage GEO Algorithm Breakdown, 2024](https://firstpagesage.com/seo-blog/generative-engine-optimization-geo-explanation/). Numbers are reframed as "observed correlations, not model internals".
- `optimize-page` adds a methodology note next to the +40% paper-benchmark lift claim: the paper allowed fabricated quotes/stats in test prose; the plugin enforces "never invent" so real-world lift varies.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-05-26

Skill catalog restructure: 13 skills + 5 agents + 8 commands, grouped by workflow (Audit · Optimize · Content · AI Search · Localization). **Breaking** — skill slugs `on-page-seo`, `aeo-optimization`, `geo-optimization`, and the `ai-visibility-score` skill are removed.

### Added
- `optimize-page` skill — single-page SEO + AEO + GEO pass with `--mode=full|seo|aeo|geo` modifier. Applies Princeton/IIT Delhi GEO tactics.
- `competitor-intel` skill — side-by-side scorecard + ranked counter-move plan for 1–5 named competitors. Hands off to `competitor-analyzer` agent for deep autonomous research.

### Changed
- `ai-visibility` skill — Phase 1 calls the Akii backend for the 0–100 score + 4-dim breakdown; Phase 2 layers the per-engine proxy map. Single unified report.
- `technical-seo` description has explicit NOT carve-outs (no per-page copy, no JSON-LD gen, no internal-link suggestions, no full multi-layer site audits).
- Slash command renamed: `/seo-check` → `/check-file`.
- `/ai-visibility-score` command kept as score-only inline action; cross-refs the merged `ai-visibility` skill for the full report.
- README skill table regrouped under 5 workflow headers.

### Removed
- `on-page-seo` skill → folded into `optimize-page`.
- `aeo-optimization` skill → folded into `optimize-page` (`--mode=aeo`).
- `geo-optimization` skill → folded into `optimize-page` (`--mode=geo`).
- `ai-visibility-score` skill → folded into `ai-visibility`.
